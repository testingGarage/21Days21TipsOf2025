# #21Days21Tips 2025 -- My Tips for Test Engineers
#### Drafting my 21 tips here to share as part of initiative from The Test Chat.  I'm sharing the tips on using the Git and GitHub for those who are trying it for the first time.  Do you have difficulty in implemeting and practicing these tips? Just reach out to me.  I will assist.

# 1. Day 1's Tip - Build a habit to Push at least one commit in a day.
- Create your account either on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab
- Pick the publicly hosted test resources.
    - Test, Automate, Make Notes
    - Push your test artefacts
        - Use this as a placeholder to showcase your skills
        - This will be your professional portfolio
- Build and make it a **habit** to push atleast one meaningful outcome from your practice in a day.
    - No need of 70 hrs work in a week to do this.
    - The five meaningful push in a week shows your growth and learning.
    - Test Artefact is not confined to the code and compiled files alone.


- Installing Git [^1]
- Setting up Git [^2]

> git config --global user.name "name"

> git config --global user.email "my@email.com"

    make sure this email is configured in the GitHub account of yours. Profile -> Settings -> Access -> Emails.

> git --global user.name

> git --global user.email

**Note**: Never use or push your organization's work into your personal account.


# 2. Day 2's Tip - Prioritize creating the ReadMe and .gitignore files.
Every repository you create, it should have these two files.
1. ReadMe.md
2. .gitignore

## ReadMe and Markdown
The ReadMe file type can be a simple plain text.  But, practice writing this file in Markdown. It gives a better readability and structuring.

Here are few resources you should refer
- What is Markdown? [^3]
- How to write ReadMe file? [^4]
- Markdown Cheat Sheet [^5]

## Ignoring Files - .gitignore
There is no need to checkin all the files and folders into GitHub.  This can be accomplished by addming .gitingore file in the root of the repository.

This is must and useful to maintain the repository with what is needed.

Here are few resources you should refer:
- Why should on ignore certain files from checkin? [^6]
- .gitignore file templates. [^7]
- Reference to .gitignore file content. [^8]

[^6]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/ignoring-files
[^7]: https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main
[^8]: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore

You should be adding these two files as a must on creating a repository.  And, importantly it should be updated as the project and repository evolves.

# 3. Day 3's Tip - Create a repoistory and clone it. Commit changes. Push your commit.

To push the committed changes you need a remote repository on GitHub.  The same holds good for any other Git based code hosting cloud platform.

## Use this Approach to Push
Yet to make your first Push to the remote repository? Then,
1. For first clone the created repo to your local.
2. Create a branch locally and checkout to it.
3. Add file[s] and commit to this branch.
4. When pushing set the upstream to pointed to the created branch.

        git clone <remote_repo_url.git>
        git checkout -b dev
        git add <file_names>
        git commit -m "commit message"
        git push --set-upstream origin dev


Note: From next Push to the same branch, you can use,

           git push origin dev

 ## Avoid this Approach to Push

1. Initializing the local folder as git folder. 
2. Adding the files and committing the changes. 
3. Setting the origin to the remote repo URL. 
4. And, pushing the changes to the remote.

        git remote add origin <remote_repo_url.git>

### Why this should be avoided?
- Pointing the origin to remote repo URL, if gone wrong, it is a waste of time in troubleshooting.
- And, not a approach to be taken by one who is starting to use Git and GitHub for the first time.

# Day 4's Tip - Know the Branch or create one and commit to it. Do not work on Main.
- Cloning a repository, know the Branch to which you have to commit.
- Know when the Branch to commit was created. If you see this branch exist for a long time, talk to your team and stakeholders why this branch is so long lived.

        How to quantify the "long"?  

        Your experiences will let you know that.  
        
        If not aware, have this thumb rule:
            a Branch living more than a sprint time in your setup, you need to ask about it to know if that is the right branch to use.

- If there is no branch yet, create one and commit to it.
- Keep an eye on number of Branch you are creating.   
    - Do you see too many branches? You need to ask about it and pick the right one.  Too many branches is an indication of could be something not going [or working] well.
- Do not work on the Main.
    - Say, you are fixing an automation run that is failing.
        - Fetch the master to your local.
        - Create a new Branch.
        - Make changes in this Branch to fix the code which is failing.
        - Commit this change and Push to remote.
        - Make a PR to review and Merge this change to Main.
            - Run the automation once your fix is Merged to the Main. It is the Test to your fix to know it is not broken and breaking anything else.
    - Doing so, you will have exact and precise reference to what you did.
        - Once Merged to Main, others can pull you code fix which is available in Main now.
    - Other team members can know what is your change from the PR along with Branch you have created.

Note that, I'm not saying -- do not have a copy of Master in local. I'm saying, do not commit to Main on remote repo for straight.  Instead use Branch and from there merge to Main.  Such practice varies and depends on team to team and within teams in an org.  Know how your setup runs.

# Day 5's Tip - The Branch name should tell what it is, who created and should be part of Code Review.
- The naming of a Branch is strategic and well practiced engineering.
- To illustrate this, look at the Branch name "draftingv1", where this tip is being pushed.
    - Does this name "draftingv1" tell you what the Branch is for?
    - In my opinion, that's a bad naming of a Branch.

## My Push Strategy for 21 Tips
- My strategy to post the 21Days21Tips for 2025 is,
    - Make 3 PRs.
    - Each PR will have 7 Tips.
    - Each PR will point to its respective Branch.
        -  That is, I will create 3 Branch. Each Branch will have 7 Tips.

## Strategic and Meaningful Branch Names
- In this approach, the better name for Branch is,
    1. **Week1Tips** 
    2. **Week2Tips** 
    3. **Week3Tips**

- I'm keep it short and no characters other than English alphabet letters and Number.
- I can understand in quick time what it means and what it has.
- It can help others to relate what it is when looked into it.
- My work is in meaningful blocks rather having all 21 Tips under one Branch.
    - A Branch having multiple commits and PRs will be energy, time and emotion draining if it has to be troubleshooted later.

            How do you quantify "multiple" here?  Talk to the reviewer of your code.  Talk to your Principal and Staff Engineer.  They will let know for your context.

## Renaming a Branch
- One can rename the **local Branch** using the below command.

        git branch -m oldBranchName newBranchName

- The above command takes -m and -M as an argument.
    - -m is for move (rename) a branch together with its config and reflog.
    - -M is for force move.
    - The meaning and purpose -m and -M are not same.
    - Explore on it when to use what.
- But, what actually happens is, we are moving the content to a new Branch
    - The old Branch will remain
    - We need to delete the old Branch in local and remote.
    - And, then set the upstream pointed to the new Branch.

            git branch --unset-upstream
            git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/newBranchName newBranchName

Note: I'm talking about renaming the Branch in local.  **The new renamed Branch has to be pushed to remote, before setting the upstream to i**t.

Do you see the pain and time wasted in renaming, deleting, unsetting and setting the upstream for a Branch?

It is better to practice the strategic and progressive engineering approach to name the Branch.

## Branch Name and Code Review
1. Do your Code Review talk about the Branch name?
2. Did you receive any feedback on Brach name from the Code Review?
3. The Branch name should be part of your Code Review.

Do you recall the purpose of Branch that you created 2 weeks back?

# Day 6's Tip - You can converse easily with Git on understanding its words and language.

I see, the hestitation arises due to unaware of language and its words.  Be it human to human communication, or human and other system communication.  Git is no excpetion it. Understanding some of the often used words in Git is helpful to continue using it without getting intimidated.

## The Three States
Git has 3 main states in which the files can reside in.
1. Modified (unstaged)
2. Staged
3. Committed

## Working Directory (Unstaged)

- The local directory where the files are created and changes are made.
- The changes are not yet added to Index.
- The files are added to Index using the below command.

            git add fileNames
## Index (Staged)
- The files in this area are not yet committed
- On successful commit, 
    - It takes the contents of the Index and saves it as a permanent snapsot.
        - Creates a commit object which points to this snapshot.
    Updates the Head to point this commit.
- To commit the changes use the below command

            git commit -m "commit messages."
## HEAD
- It refers to the latest commit by default.
- It tells you, where are you at the present.
- Most of the time, HEAD points to a Branch.
    - When HEAD is not pointing to a Branch, it is a state called Detatched HEAD.
        - This is not an error.
        - It is just saying, you are looking to a particular commit instead of a Branch.
        - In the next tip, we will look into this.


### Colors and Words on Git Terminal
- Head is represented by Cyan color
- Remote Branch is represented by Red color

![Git log showing the Head and Origin having the same commit snapshot](/resources/day6TipPic_gitLog_4.png "Git log showing the HEAD and Origin having the snap shot.")
HEAD and Remote Origin pointing to the same commit.

![Git showing the modified (unstaged) file is ready for moving to Index (Staging).](/resources/day6TipPic_gitLog_0.png "Git showing the modified (unstaged) file is ready for moving to Index (Staging).")
A file is modified and it is not yet staged.

![Git showing the file is added to Index and ready to Commit the changes](/resources/day6TipPic_gitLog_2.png "Modified file is added to Index (staged) and ready to commit.")
The modified file is staged.

![Git showing nothing to commit and Branch is ahead of the Remote Origin](/resources/day6TipPic_gitLog_3.png "Git showing nothing to commit and position of Head and Remote Origin.")
The staged file is committed and ready for Push.

![Git log showing the Branch and Remote Origin position are not pointing to the same commit.](/resources/day6TipPic_gitLog_1.png "Git log showing the Branch and Remote Origin not pointing to same commit.")
The HEAD is ahead of Remote Origin because the commit is not yet pushed to remote.

Understanding these words and its context will help you converse with Git and your team on code collaboration.
1. Unstaged
2. Index
3. Staged
4. Committed
5. HEAD
6. Detached HEAD
7. Commit Hash
8. Origin
9. Remote
10. Remote Origin
11. Repository
12. Merge Conflict
13. Rebase
14. Hooks
15. Cherry-pick
16. Stash
17. Relog
18. Diff
19. Restore
20. Fork

Note: This is not the all. But, knowing the purpose of these words, will help you to start conversing confidently with Git.

# Day 7's Tip - Clone and Fork are two different approaches to work on a repository and make a PR request for the merge.

If you have a GitHub account, more likely you could have also **forked** a repository.  You might also have watched someone's repository having a forked project.  What is this fork?  When should one use it? How is fork and clone are different?

## Clone and Fork

### Git Clone
- It is a Git command used to create a local copy of a remote repository.
- It duplicates the remote repository and its content to one's local machine.
    - When this happens, a Git folder is created in my local machine.

I use the Git Clone command when I want to contribute to a project.  This can be an existing project or a new project that is just created.

### Git Fork
- It is not a Git's command.
- Instead, it is a feature on GitHub and other code hosting platforms.
- For example, I can **fork** an existing GitHub repository to my GitHub's account.
    - Doing so, I see that is a forked repository.
    - On successful fork, this forked repository is not seen my local machine.
        - Instead, this is seen on cloud space of my GitHub's account.


## When to use Clone and Fork?
- Git clone is used when I want to contribute to a project.
- Fork is used when I want to refer a repository for reference.
    - Also, I can use Fork when I want to add a new feature or an idea to an existing repository.
    - And, then submit this idea or feature for review for approval.
        - Here I'm working independently and not as a team.
            - For first, I will fork the repository.
            - Then, I will clone it to my local.
            - I start working on it to implement my thought (idea/feature/fix)
            - I push the changes to my forked repository.
            - Submit a PR to the original repository which is sent to maintainers of forked repository.
            - In this PR, I will mention what is the change I have made with context and needed details.
            - If you see, I'm doing all this because I do not have write access to that original repository

I will use **clone** when I have write access and wanting to contribute by collaborating.

I will use **fork** when I want to contribute to a repository for which I do not have write access.  Note that forking is not **mirroring** the repository.

When to mirror a repository? Explore on it.  In my so far experience, I have not mirroed any repository as a backup.  But, you should be knowing about it. Explore!

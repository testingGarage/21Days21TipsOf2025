# 1. Day 1's Tip - Build a habit to push at least one commit in a day.
- Create your account either on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab
- Pick the publicly hosted test resources.
    - Test, Automate, Make Notes
    - Push your test artefacts
        - Use this as a placeholder to showcase your skills
        - This will be your professional portfolio
- Build and make it a **habit** to push atleast one meaningful outcome from your practice in a day.
    - No need of 70 hrs work in a week to do this.
    - The five meaningful push in a week shows your growth and learning.
    - Test Artefact is not confined to the code and compiled files alone.

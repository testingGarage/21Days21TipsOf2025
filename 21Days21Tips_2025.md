# #21Days21Tips 2025 -- My Tips for Test Engineers
#### Drafting my 21 tips here to share as part of initiative from The Test Chat.  I'm sharing the tips on using the Git and GitHub for those who are trying it for the first time.  Do you have difficulty in implemeting and practicing these tips? Just reach out to me.  I will assist.

# 1. Day 1's Tip - Build a habit to push at least one commit in a day.
- Create your account either on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab
- Pick the publicly hosted test resources.
    - Test, Automate, Make Notes
    - Push your test artefacts
        - Use this as a placeholder to showcase your skills
        - This will be your professional portfolio
- Build and make it a **habit** to push atleast one meaningful outcome from your practice in a day.
    - No need of 70 hrs work in a week to do this.
    - The five meaningful push in a week shows your growth and learning.
    - Test Artefact is not confined to the code and compiled files alone.


- Installing Git [^1]
- Setting up Git [^2]

> git config --global user.name "name"

> git config --global user.email "my@email.com"

    make sure this email is configured in the GitHub account of yours. Profile -> Settings -> Access -> Emails.

> git --global user.name

> git --global user.email

**Note**: Never use or push your organization's work into your personal account.

# Day 2's Tip - Prioritize creating the ReadMe and .gitignore files.
Every repository you create, it should have these two files.
1. ReadMe.md
2. .gitignore

## ReadMe and Markdown
The ReadMe file type can be a simple plain text.  But, practice writing this file in Markdown. It gives a better readability and structuring.

Here are few resources you should refer
- What is Markdown? [^3]
- How to write ReadMe file? [^4]
- Markdown Cheat Sheet [^5]

## Ignoring Files - .gitignore
There is no need to checkin all the files and folders into GitHub.  This can be accomplished by addming .gitingore file in the root of the repository.

This is must and useful to maintain the repository with what is needed.

Here are few resources you should refer:
- Why should on ignore certain files from checkin? [^6]
- .gitignore file templates. [^7]
- Reference to .gitignore file content. [^8]

[^7]: https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main
[^8]: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore

You should be adding these two files as a must on creating a repository.  And, importantly it should be updated as the project and repository evolves.

# #21Days21Tips 2025 -- My Tips for Test Engineers
#### Drafting my 21 tips here to share as part of initiative from The Test Chat.  I'm sharing the tips on using the Git and GitHub for those who are trying it for the first time.  Do you have difficulty in implemeting and practicing these tips? Just reach out to me.  I will assist.

# 1. Day 1's Tip - Build a habit to Push at least one commit in a day.
- Create your account either on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab
- Pick the publicly hosted test resources.
    - Test, Automate, Make Notes
    - Push your test artefacts
        - Use this as a placeholder to showcase your skills
        - This will be your professional portfolio
- Build and make it a **habit** to push atleast one meaningful outcome from your practice in a day.
    - No need of 70 hrs work in a week to do this.
    - The five meaningful push in a week shows your growth and learning.
    - Test Artefact is not confined to the code and compiled files alone.


- Installing Git [^1]
- Setting up Git [^2]

> git config --global user.name "name"

> git config --global user.email "my@email.com"

    make sure this email is configured in the GitHub account of yours. Profile -> Settings -> Access -> Emails.

> git --global user.name

> git --global user.email

**Note**: Never use or push your organization's work into your personal account.


# 2. Day 2's Tip - Prioritize creating the ReadMe and .gitignore files.
Every repository you create, it should have these two files.
1. ReadMe.md
2. .gitignore

## ReadMe and Markdown
The ReadMe file type can be a simple plain text.  But, practice writing this file in Markdown. It gives a better readability and structuring.

Here are few resources you should refer
- What is Markdown? [^3]
- How to write ReadMe file? [^4]
- Markdown Cheat Sheet [^5]

## Ignoring Files - .gitignore
There is no need to checkin all the files and folders into GitHub.  This can be accomplished by addming .gitingore file in the root of the repository.

This is must and useful to maintain the repository with what is needed.

Here are few resources you should refer:
- Why should on ignore certain files from checkin? [^6]
- .gitignore file templates. [^7]
- Reference to .gitignore file content. [^8]

[^6]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/ignoring-files
[^7]: https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main
[^8]: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore

You should be adding these two files as a must on creating a repository.  And, importantly it should be updated as the project and repository evolves.

# 3. Day 3's Tip - Create a repoistory and clone it. Commit changes. Push your commit.

To push the committed changes you need a remote repository on GitHub.  The same holds good for any other Git based code hosting cloud platform.

## Use this Approach to Push
Yet to make your first Push to the remote repository? Then,
1. For first clone the created repo to your local.
2. Create a branch locally and checkout to it.
3. Add file[s] and commit to this branch.
4. When pushing set the upstream to pointed to the created branch.

        git clone <remote_repo_url.git>
        git checkout -b dev
        git add <file_names>
        git commit -m "commit message"
        git push --set-upstream origin dev


Note: From next Push to the same branch, you can use,

           git push origin dev

 ## Avoid this Approach to Push

1. Initializing the local folder as git folder. 
2. Adding the files and committing the changes. 
3. Setting the origin to the remote repo URL. 
4. And, pushing the changes to the remote.

        git remote add origin <remote_repo_url.git>

### Why this should be avoided?
- Pointing the origin to remote repo URL, if gone wrong, it is a waste of time in troubleshooting.
- And, not a approach to be taken by one who is starting to use Git and GitHub for the first time.

# Day 4's Tip - Know the Branch or create one and commit to it. Do not work on Main.
- Cloning a repository, know the Branch to which you have to commit.
- Know when the Branch is created. If you feel this branch exist for a long time, talk to your team and stakeholders why this branch is long lived.

        How to quantify the "long"?  

        Your experiences will let you know that.  
        
        If not aware, have this thumb rule -- anything more than a sprint in your setup, you need to ask about it to know if that is the right branch to use.

- If there is no branch yet, create one and commit to it.
- Keep an eye on number of Branch you are creating.   
    - Do you see too many branches? You need to ask about it and pick the right one.
- Do not work on the Main.
    - Say, you are fixing an automation run that is failing.
        - Fetch the master to your local.
        - Create a new Branch.
        - Make changes in this Branch to fix the code which is failing.
        - Commit this change and Push to remote.
        - Make a PR to review and Merge this change to Main.
            - Run the automation once your fix is Merged to the Main. It is the Test to your fix that it is not broken anything else.
    - Doing so, you will have exact and precise reference to what you did.
        - Once Merged to Main, others can pull you code fix which is available in Main now.
    - Other team members can know what is your change from the PR along with Branch you have created.

Note that, I'm not saying -- do not have a copy of Master in local. I'm saying, do not commit to Main on remote repo for straight.  Instead use Branch and from there merge to Main.  Such practice varies and depends on team to team and within teams in an org.  Know how your setup runs.
